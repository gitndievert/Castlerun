CANCELED PROJECT: Castle Run (unreleased and not developed)
This was a game that I had in development for about 8 months under Wacky Potato Games. It was a combination of Fortnite 3rd person gameplay and strategy, 
where you would protect your castle against other players. The object of the game was to storm the defenses and take each players castle on the map, with a max of 4 players in the battlefield.
